This is my vim configuration folder.

I'm just getting started with it, so there are no interesting desicions whatsoever.

I keep it here for my own convenience.

# Installation

Clone the repository in your `~/.vim` folder.

Before using it you need to install [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for package management and run `:PluginInstall` from vim, or `vim +PluginInstall +qall` from command line.
